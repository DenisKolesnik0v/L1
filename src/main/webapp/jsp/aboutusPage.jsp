                <h4>ABOUT COMPANY</h4>
                The company description should be inserted here in the same font and the same text size. Tell us about yourself, what you do, how long have you been doing it.
                Also in this block you can write a few sentences about how your company started.
                You can also add a few words about
                What goals did you set for yourself and what did you achieve? All this will help in the location of the client to your company.

                With a small amount of text, you can change the block size in the settings to make the text look presentable.
                If the text is too large and the image size is set to the minimum,
                then you need to go to the block settings and resize the image so that its height matches the height of the text.

                <h4>TALK ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT</h4>
                You must not only highlight the points in your product description, but also provide enough information so that the client can make an informed decision.
                This is a compromise. You don't just have to describe product specifications. Too many companies have failed using product detail pages
                where only technical specifications were given, and there was not a word about the benefits.

                Of course, no one argues that some buyers want to read the product specification, but you should not be limited to this.
                You are more likely to sell a product if you describe the benefits along with the features. At the end of everything
                the description should use a title that talks about the benefits. Follow this example in your product descriptions.
